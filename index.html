  <div class="div" id="div1">
   <p>Greetings! My name is Don and I am an aspiring  Full Stack Web Developer.
    <p>Currently  worked as an Affiliate Marketing, Drop Shipping and many more.</p>
    <p>I studied Bachelor of Theology and have worked in Philippines as a Pastor and a Teacher. Now I'm an Associate Pastor of NJ Filipino Conference</p>
    <p>I started making Websites using Wordpress, monetizing them and using it to advertize my products.  This was the beginning of my interest in Web Developing.</p>
    <p>I hope to graduate as a Full Stack Developer this year 2018 at Galvanize NYC. I've found Galvanize  to be very helpful to pursue my goal.</p>
    <p>I love to learn and self study, kudos to Team Tree House and Udemy for my self study online, without them I can't fully grasp all the details of my courses</p>
